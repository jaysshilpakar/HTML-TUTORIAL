            #tags
            the texts with "<" and ">" are called tags.
           
            there are two types of tags:

            #single tags
            the self closing tags i.e. without a separate closing tag are called single tags.

            example: 
            "<" br  ">" no separate closing tag
            "<" hr/ ">" opening and closing in one tag
            

            #paired tags
            the tags with opening and closing tags are called paired tags.

            example:
            "<" html ">" opening tag
            "<" /html ">" closing tag

            


            #attributes
            the extra information added inside the opening tag are called attributes.
            attributes have certain specific values.

            example:
            "<" body id = "first"  ">" <"/body">"
            "<" body class = "anothervalue"  ">" <"/body">"

            Here, id and class are attributes with first and anothervalue as their corresponding values.


            
            #elements
            the total information inside the tags including the tags are called elements.

            example:
            "<"title">"htmlbasics"</"title">"

            the above whole inforamtion is a title element.
